# SOC_RAP
WEEK 1 : In first week i have revised about the basics of python programming where i have covered the topics like lists, tuples, loops, Functions,
and OOPs concepts also i revised some basics syntax in NumPy libraries.

WEEK 2 : In second week i have learnt various new topics like hand tracking, face detection and recognition using the hand traking modules and mediapie modules, haar cascade classifiers and OpenCv module respectively.
Aftercommpleting above topics i have learnt various intresting and cool topics like Deep learning Fundamentals and bascis of neural networks like input, output, hidden layers and activation functions in neural networks like ReLu, softmax, sigmoid, leaky ReLu functions and later i have learnt about training, testing and validation of the build neural networks and also topics like backpropagation and vanishing gradient were also learnt 
and now using the fundamentals of the deep learning techniques learnt i have learnt keras with tensorflow modules to build the neural networks.
